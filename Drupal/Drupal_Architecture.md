# Drupal Architecture Overview

Drupal is a popular open-source content management system (CMS) known for its flexibility and extensibility. This document provides an overview of the key components of Drupal's architecture, along with diagrams to illustrate their interactions.

## 1. Core
Drupal core contains the essential features and functionalities required to run the CMS. This includes the main application logic, APIs, and default modules that provide basic CMS capabilities such as user management, content creation, and site administration.

```
+------------------+
|    Drupal Core   |
+------------------+
| - Application    |
|   Logic          |
| - APIs           |
| - Default        |
|   Modules        |
+------------------+
```

## 2. Modules
Modules are plugins that extend the functionality of Drupal. There are three types of modules:
- **Core Modules:** Included with Drupal core and provide essential features.
- **Contributed Modules:** Developed by the Drupal community and shared on Drupal.org.
- **Custom Modules:** Developed by site builders or developers to meet specific requirements.

```
+------------------+
|     Modules      |
+------------------+
| - Core Modules   |
| - Contributed    |
|   Modules        |
| - Custom Modules |
+------------------+
```

## 3. Themes
Themes control the presentation layer of a Drupal site. They determine how the content is displayed to the users. Themes consist of templates, stylesheets, JavaScript, and other assets. Themes can be:
- **Core Themes:** Included with Drupal core.
- **Contributed Themes:** Available from the Drupal community.
- **Custom Themes:** Created specifically for a particular site.

```
+------------------+
|      Themes      |
+------------------+
| - Core Themes    |
| - Contributed    |
|   Themes         |
| - Custom Themes  |
+------------------+
```

## 4. Content Types and Entities
Drupal's content is structured using content types and entities. Content types are templates for creating different kinds of content (e.g., articles, pages). Entities are data structures that store content and configuration (e.g., nodes, users, taxonomy terms).

```
+---------------------+
| Content Types       |
| and Entities        |
+---------------------+
| - Content Types     |
| - Entities          |
|   (Nodes, Users,    |
|   Taxonomy Terms)   |
+---------------------+
```

## 5. Blocks
Blocks are reusable pieces of content that can be placed in various regions of a theme. They can display static content, dynamic content, or interactive features.

```
+--------+
| Blocks |
+--------+
```

## 6. Views
Views is a powerful module that allows users to create, manage, and display lists of content. It provides a UI for building queries to fetch and display content in various formats.

```
+-------+
| Views |
+-------+
```

## 7. Configuration Management
Drupal has a robust configuration management system that allows site configuration to be exported, versioned, and imported. This is especially useful for deploying changes between environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

```
+-----------------------------+
| Configuration Management    |
+-----------------------------+
```

## 8. Hooks and Events
Drupal uses a hook system that allows modules to interact with the core and other modules. Hooks are functions that get called at specific points in the execution of Drupal. Additionally, Drupal 8 introduced an event system that follows the Symfony Event Dispatcher pattern.

```
+------------------+
| Hooks and Events |
+------------------+
```

## 9. Services and Dependency Injection
Drupal 8 and later versions utilize the Symfony service container for dependency injection, allowing for better organization and reuse of code.

```
+-----------------------------+
| Services and Dependency     |
| Injection                  |
+-----------------------------+
```

## 10. Routing and Menu System
Drupal's routing system defines how URLs are handled and how requests are routed to the appropriate controllers. The menu system manages navigation links and routes.

```
+--------------------+
| Routing and Menu   |
| System             |
+--------------------+
```

## 11. API and Web Services
Drupal provides robust APIs for interacting with the system programmatically. It also supports web services (REST, JSON:API, GraphQL) to expose content and functionality to external applications.

```
+-------------------------+
| API and Web Services    |
+-------------------------+
```

## File Structure Overview
The typical directory structure of a Drupal installation includes:
- **core/**: The core Drupal codebase.
- **modules/**: Custom and contributed modules.
- **themes/**: Custom and contributed themes.
- **sites/**: Site-specific configuration and files.
- **profiles/**: Installation profiles for specific site setups.
